# Airbnb NYC 2019 Data Analysis

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focusing on Airbnb listings in New York City for 2019. The dataset, comprising approximately 49,000 entries and 16 attributes, provides insights into pricing trends, guest activity, host behavior, and neighborhood dynamics. This project aims to uncover actionable insights to assist Airbnb hosts, guests, and stakeholders in making data-driven decisions.

## Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to analyze the NYC Airbnb market by exploring:

- **Pricing Trends**: Examining variations across room types and neighborhoods to understand market dynamics.
- **Guest Activity**: Measuring engagement through reviews and availability metrics.
- **Host Behavior**: Understanding listing strategies and their impact on performance.
- **Neighborhood Dynamics**: Identifying influential factors driving Airbnb success across NYC boroughs.

These insights aim to provide strategies for optimizing pricing, improving guest satisfaction, and identifying market opportunities.

## Key Findings

- **Neighborhood Dominance**:
  - Manhattan and Brooklyn lead the market with the highest number of listings and guest activity, highlighting their appeal to travelers.

- **Room Type Pricing**:
  - Entire homes/apartments dominate higher price ranges, catering to premium travelers.
  - Private rooms offer mid-range pricing, while shared rooms cater to budget-conscious travelers.

- **Guest Engagement**:
  - Listings with frequent reviews are concentrated in high-demand areas like Manhattan and Brooklyn, reflecting consistent guest turnover.
